# contact-search-flow

The contact search implementation enforces specific business rules and constraints when interacting with Apollo.io's contact search functionality:

## Search Constraints
- Page size limits strictly enforced between 1-100 contacts per page
- Maximum search depth capped at 500 pages total
- Structured parameter validation for contact queries

## Contact Stage Integration
- Integrates with Apollo.io's hierarchical contact stage system 
- Manages contact stage transitions and state
- Enforces valid stage progression rules

## Query Parameter Handling
- Domain-specific parameter validation
- Business rule enforcement for search criteria
- Structured error handling for API limitations

## Core Components
`src/ant/apollo_io/apollo.py`:
- Implements Apollo.io contact search business rules
- Manages pagination constraints
- Handles contact stage workflow

Importance Score: 35/100
- Implements specific Apollo.io business requirements
- Focused on API integration with business constraints
- Limited complex domain logic or unique algorithms
- Basic parameter validation with business-specific rules
