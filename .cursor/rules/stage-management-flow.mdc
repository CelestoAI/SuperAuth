# stage-management-flow

The contact stage management system implements hierarchical contact states within the Apollo.io integration:

Key Components:
1. Stage Hierarchy
- Integrated with Apollo.io's native contact stage system
- Manages stage transitions and state validation
- Maintains parent-child relationships between stages

2. Stage Transitions
- Enforces valid state changes based on Apollo.io's contact workflow
- Handles stage progression through the contact lifecycle
- Implements business rules for allowed/disallowed transitions

Relevant Files:
- src/ant/apollo_io/apollo.py (Primary stage management implementation)

Technical Flow:
1. Contact stages are managed through Apollo's hierarchical system
2. Stage transitions follow Apollo.io's defined contact workflow
3. Integration provides access to stage management functionality

Importance Score: 45/100
- Implements critical contact stage workflow
- Integrates with external stage management system
- Limited custom business logic beyond API integration
