## Core Data Structures

### Apollo Class Hierarchy
- Parent class managing API authentication and core Apollo.io interactions
- Handles domain-specific constraints for Apollo.io API access
- Enforces business rules for pagination (1-100 per page, max 500 pages)

### Contact Management Model
- Contact class implementing Apollo.io's contact stage system
- Structured query parameter handling for contact search operations
- Parent-child relationship with Apollo base class for authentication inheritance

## Business Domain Logic

### Contact Search Implementation
- Domain-specific contact search with Apollo.io constraints
- Structured parameter validation for Apollo.io's API requirements
- Contact stage hierarchy management and state transitions

### Domain Authentication
- Apollo.io-specific authentication handling
- Business domain error boundaries for API limitations
- Integrated access control for contact management operations

Importance Score: 35/100
- Implements Apollo.io's specific business requirements
- Provides structured interface for domain operations
- Focuses on API integration with business constraints
- Limited complex domain-specific processing
