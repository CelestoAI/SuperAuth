## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements an Apollo.io API integration layer with two primary business components:

## Contact Search Management
Located in `src/ant/apollo_io/apollo.py`, this component:
- Enforces domain-specific pagination rules (1-100 contacts per page)
- Implements maximum depth constraints of 500 pages
- Handles structured contact search parameters
- Maintains business-domain authentication context

## Contact Stage System
The contact stage management system provides:
- Integration with Apollo.io's hierarchical stage organization
- Stage transition handling
- Contact stage status tracking

## Business Logic Score: 35/100
The implementation primarily serves as a structured API wrapper with basic business constraints and validation rules. While it enforces specific Apollo.io business requirements, it contains limited complex domain logic or unique business algorithms.
